Iteratively calculate the sum of the integer series from 1 to n. This is similar to the factorial() function, except it performs addition instead of multiplication.

For example, sumSeries(1) returns 1, sumSeries(2) returns 3 (that is, 1 + 2), sumSeries(3) returns 6 (that is, 1 + 2 + 3), and so on.

This function should use a loop instead of recursion. Take a look at the factorialByIteration.py program in this chapter for guidance.
